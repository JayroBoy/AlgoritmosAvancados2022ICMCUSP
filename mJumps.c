Mountain Jumps

Given N mountains and the heights of each mountain, calculate the minimum amount of energy
needed in order to go from mountain 1 to mountain n. Going from mountain A to mountain B
costs, in energy, the vertical distance between them. You can go from mountain x to mountains
x+1 or x+2.
