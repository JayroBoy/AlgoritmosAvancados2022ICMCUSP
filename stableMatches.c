/*This program receives a number T, which is the number of test cases
It then repeats the following procedure T times:
 1 - Read the number C of couples
 2 - Read the preferences of C women, in the following format:
    [Woman#1][Man #1][Man #2]...[Man#C]
    .           .        .         .   
    .           .        .         .
    .           .        .         .
    [Woman#C][Man #1][Man #2]...[Man#C]

    (Without the []'s)
    Where the earlier a man appears on a given woman's list, the more she likes him

 3 - Read the preferences of C men, in the following format:
    [Man#1][Woman #1][Woman #2]...[Woman#C]
    .           .        .         .   
    .           .        .         .
    .           .        .         .
    [Man#C][Woman #1][Woman #2]...[Woman#C]
    (Without the []'s)
    Where the earlier a woman appears on a given man's list, the more he likes her

 4 - Based on these lists of preferences, produce a stable configuration of marriages, that is,
a configuration in which there is no (man, woman) pair that would benefit from separating from 
both's current partners to marry each other. In other words, if a man likes a woman more than 
he likes his wife, that woman likes her husband more than she likes this man, and if a woman likes
a man more than she likes her husband, that man likes his wife more than he likes this woman.

 5 - Print the final configurations for all test cases in order, in the following format
     M_1  W_M1
     M_2  W_M2
      .    .
      .    .
      .    .
     M_C  W_MC

    Where M_n means Man n and W_Mn means wife of Man n

/*
The Gale Shapley algorithm, also known as the mating ritual, consists of a series of steps
to find out a stable matching configuration for N men and N women, considering all men and women
are willing to date any person of the opposite sex, have a well-ordered list of preferences and 
have static preferences.
It's steps are as follows:

1 - Initialize every man and woman as free
2 - While there is a free man with a non-empty list
    2.1 - Have this man propose to the first woman in his list and remove her from his list
    2.2 If this woman is free:
        2.2.1 She gets engaged to this man
    2.3 If this woman is not free:
        2.3.1 If this woman prefers this man to her current fiancee:
            2.3.1.1 She gets engaged to this man
            2.3.1.2 Her ex-fiancee becomes free
        2.3.2 If this woman prefers her current fiancee to this man:
            2.3.2.1 Nothing changes

Once there are no more free men with non-empty lists, 
every man will be partnered with the first woman on 
his list that will not cheat on him, and every woman will
be partnered with the last man on her list that she will 
not cheat on(Meaning this is man-optimal and woman-pessimal).
If we swap the roles of men and women in the algorithm, it
then becomes woman-optimal
